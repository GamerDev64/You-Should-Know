It's not a very big deal
I just thought Heaven would glow
I lost my life to get here
And I'm so fucking bored

I don't wanna die this way and you should know 
I'm looking at your eyes and you super fucking don't 
I wanna steal a car and crash it right into a court 
Fuck someone's professor even if it's not my own

'Cause I don't wanna go like this 
So goddamn bored 
I don't wanna live this way 
And you should know

Looking at the sky, can't believe it's real 
It's so fucking synthetic, 
I don't know how to feel 
Settle on nothing, 
I'm gonna burn it down 
Rip it like a curtain and toss it to the ground 
'Cause I don't wanna go this way and you should know 
I'm looking at your eyes and, god, you just don't

Walk into the ocean
And swim away
Trade a boring life for
One real bad day
